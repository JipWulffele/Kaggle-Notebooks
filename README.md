# Kaggle-Notebooks

Welcome to my Kaggle Notebooks repository! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks from various Kaggle competitions, where I explore data, build models, and analyze results.

## ðŸ“Œ Current Competitions

### [CIBMTR - Equity in post-HCT Survival Predictions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cibmtr-equity)
- **Goal:** Develop predictive models for post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survival while addressing equity concerns.
- **Approach:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JipWulffele/Kaggle-Notebooks.git
   cd kaggle-notebooks
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   If required, install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the notebook:**
   Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## ðŸ“Œ Future Plans
- Add more notebooks from other Kaggle competitions.
- Improve documentation and model explanations.
- Experiment with different machine learning techniques.
